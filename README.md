### Something's definitely wrong here. Can you refactor the code to make it better?

##### TIP: You might want to look for:

```
-redundant or repeated code,
-confusing variable and method names,
-access modifiers
-String values that could be constants
```
##### Try to use as many IntelliJ Code shortcuts and features as you can.
